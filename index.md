## What is Ponder?
It's an app for invite-only text conversations that anyone can read. Think of it as a hybrid of
social media and text messaging, or a platform for real-time podcasts over text.

Users can subscribe to a conversation to follow it in real time just like regular text messaging.
Subscribers will receive push notifications for every message in the convo.

The message feed isn't driven by an algorithm â€” users only see the conversations that they subscribe to
and they're guaranteed to receive every message in those convos, just like regular text messaging.

## How does it work?
* Create a conversation and optionally invite others to join
* The conversation starts when at least one person accepts the invitation
* Conversations can be read by anyone, but only those who were invited can write messages

## What can you do with it?
* Create a convo by yourself to post your thoughts on a specific topic or cover a range of topics over time
* Interview or debate someone
* Post entertaining, informative, or just interesting content to your audience

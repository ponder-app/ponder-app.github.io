## What is Ponder?
It's an app for invite-only text conversations that anyone can read. Think of it as a hybrid of
social media and text messaging, or a platform for real-time podcasts over text.

Users can subscribe to a conversation to follow it in real time just like regular text messaging.
Subscribers will receive push notifications for every message in the convo.

The message feed isn't driven by an algorithm ‚Äî users only see the conversations that they subscribe to
and they're guaranteed to receive every message in those convos in the order that they were sent.

## How does it work?
* Create a conversation and optionally invite others to join
* The conversation starts when at least one person accepts the invitation
* Conversations can be read by anyone, but only those who were invited can write messages

## What can you do with it?
* Invite one or more people to talk about a shared interest
* Remove participants and invite new ones over time to cover a variety of topics
* Interview or debate someone in a public forum
* Create a convo by yourself to post your thoughts on a specific topic; kind of like
  a Tweet thread except it's organized.
* Post informative or entertaining content to your audience

## Example convos
* `Crypto`: What are the benefits and downsides of changing to a crypto-based economy? Is it
  forced for the sake of innovation and change?
* `Politics`: What's the underlying psychological cause of the political divide in the US? Is it a
  sign of emotional problems on all sides?
* `Finance and Investment`: Post updates about your daily trading activity and discuss your reasoning
  in real-time. üöÄ üåù?
* `Fitness`: Share your daily workout routine and lessons learned throughout the process.
* `Music`: Post your favorite music discoveries. Share the beats.
* `Humor`: Oh you're funny, you say? The floor is yours.

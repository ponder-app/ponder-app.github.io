## What is Ponder?
It's an app for invite-only text conversations that anyone can read. Think of it as a hybrid of
social media and text messaging, or a platform for real-time podcasts over text.

Users can subscribe to a conversation to follow it in real-time just like regular text messaging.
Subscribers will receive push notifications for every message in the convo.

## How does it work?
* Create a conversation and optionally invite others to join
* The conversation starts when at least one person accepts the invitation
* Conversations can be read by anyone, but only those who were invited can write messages

## What can you do with it?
* Have a conversation with others (of course)
* Create a convo by yourself to post your thoughts on a specific topic or cover a range of topics over time
* Interview or debate someone
* Post funny or just interesting content to your audience
